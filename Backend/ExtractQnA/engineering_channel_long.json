Expired certificates or using an IP address in your application when the certificate does not contain a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) IP entry to secure traffic to the IP address are also common issues. One way to handle any failure is in the code using verify=False as in your example, although this is not really recommended as you're essentially disabling certificate verification which can be risky from a security standpoint. This is not suggested in production environments. However, it might be necessary in certain situations such as an expired certificate which you have no control over to replace it. If it's a self-signed certificate or untrusted CA another way to handle this may be importing the self-signed certificate or the untrusted CA into your trusted certificate store, or Splunk's certificate store if it uses its own. Adding a certificate to your systems certificate store is different for each OS or even between distro's of Linux. You can use your browser to examine SSL certificate and see if you get the same verification failure or not. Otherwise this page, from freecodecamp, goes into some detail about using the openssl utility to examine certificates, identify the signer (CA or self signed) or download the certificate so you could import it into a store. Separately this discussion at splunk.com has a very similar question and a solution that suggests using openssl_capath_env / SSL_CERT_DIR to resolve the verification failure when the certificate is not trusted."

                "@rioV8 I see you removed the vscode-extensions tag, but the way I interpret the description, it should be added, I actually want to develop. Correct me if I'm wrong. \"Use this tag for questions about the Visual Studio Code Extension API and extension development. Questions only about extension usage should use the [visual-studio-code] tag instead\"",
                "here inside of the documentation they use <| for html completion maybe there is a typo inside of the github instruction ",
                "did you actually type \"<d|\" with the \"|\"? I'm pretty sure the \"|\" is just an indicator of where the cursor/caret is after typing \"<d\". Also, have you touched the editor.quickSuggestions setting at all anywhere?",
                "@Shad0w I tried < and <| and <d and <d|. Nothing worked. ",
                "@starball Yeah, I agree that the | is probably the caret. I didn't touch any code. If I open a regular .html file, I will have code completion"
